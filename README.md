This is a multi-party computation protocol for the key-generation step of Pinocchio zkSNARKs [[PGHR13]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/279) designed for use in the Zcash "Sprout" public parameter ceremony.

## Zcash Ceremony

The public parameters (zk-SNARK proving and verifying keys) for Zcash's 1.0 "Sprout" launch
were constructed in a ceremony that took place on October 22-23.

The following individuals participated in the ceremony:

* Andrew Miller
* Peter Van Valkenberg
* John Dobbertin
* Zooko Wilcox
* Derek Hinch
* Peter Todd

The ceremony used a multi-party computation protocol with the property that the resulting
parameters are secure unless _all_ of the participants were dishonest or compromised
during the ceremony.

#### r1cs

This is the rank-1 quadratic constraint system used by Zcash. You can use Zcash to construct it with the following PR: <https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/3691>.

#### transcript

This is a transcript of the protocol that can be used to verify the protocol's evaluation and construct the proving/verifying keys.

 1. The participants can use it to verify that their computations were included
    in the proving/verifying keys

 2. You can verify that the protocol was performed correctly and the published proving/verifying keys are actually the ones that were
    generated during the ceremony

It contains the initial commitment of each of the participants, and the contents of their disc 'B', disc 'D' and disc 'F'.

#### sprout-*.key

These are the final parameters that can be built from the transcript.

#### finalmpc2-*.iso

These are reproducibly generated Live CD images used during the ceremony, using a modified [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) distribution.

The minimal operating system is patched with [grsecurity](https://grsecurity.net/), an extensive security enhancement to the Linux kernel. The compute nodes have a restrictive RBAC (role-based access control) policy which is intended to allow *only* the execution of code and granting of permissions that are necessary for its function. The ISOs are built inside [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers.

### Code and verification

The code used for the ceremony was tagged at `finalmpc2`. It's mostly written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

#### ISOs

The participants all booted from the `finalmpc2-compute.iso` on hardware they obtained securely. It can be reproducibly built using the `build-iso.sh` tool. Some of the participants also used `finalmpc2-network.iso` for the networking during the ceremony, though it was not necessary.

#### Transcript verification

Given `r1cs` and `transcript`, and powerful enough hardware, you can verify the protocol transcript and construct `pk`/`vk` within a few hours. Run `cargo run --release --bin verifier`.

Here is the log from verifying the transcript:
